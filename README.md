# fontspec-test-fonts

Open sources fonts for use in unit testing the `fontspec` and `unicode-math` packages.

None of these fonts have been written by me.

The fonts are freely distributable but you should track them down to their source
if possible if you want to use them.
The fonts are NOT kept up-to-date since the tests in some cases rely on specific
behaviour from an old version.

If you are the owner or maintainer of one of these fonts and you would like me
to remove any of them from this repository, please get in touch.
